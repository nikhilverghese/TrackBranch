# TrackBranch
Project 1 for CS3200

**TrackBranch**

**TLDR:**
TrackBranch is a centralized database for music producers to organize and easily locate past projects based on project attributes such as song keys and BPM. The program allows producers to streamline their workflow, save time, and enhance creativity by removing the need to waste time searching for projects. 

**Features:**<br />
-Custom Notes: Create custom notes for each track to give context or provide ideas to add to later<br />
-Filtering: Use project contents such as BPM, key, and name to filter all your projects<br />
-Custom attributes: Create custom attributes to filter by<br />
-Exported Match: Connects exported tracks and versions to the original project<br />

Having produced over one hundred songs and created over two hundred projects in the past four years, I have wasted tens of hours trying to locate older songs to grab instruments and samples for current projects. Iâ€™m creating TrackBranch so that producers can spend more time actually producing and less time playing hide-and-seek with their past projects.

**Use cases:**<br />
-Locate Projects: Easily locate projects using filters<br />
-Specific instruments: Highlight noteworthy instruments that appear frequently in tracks that can easily direct you to specific projects<br />
-Manage multi-version exports: Easily locate and connect different exports of the same project<br />
